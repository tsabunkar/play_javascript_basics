CLOSURE -
->A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain.
->The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly   brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.
->The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s parameters.
